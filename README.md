# MyReads Project

MyReads is a React Application for book tracking and searching. It utilizes a third party API to obtain book information and allows a user to search for interesting books and add those to certain shelves on their home page. The shelves include the following: Currently Reading, Read, Want to Read. These are used to help organize the books chosen by the user.
